preprocess:

The given input txt file can be seen as a sample x itemset matrix
each row is a record as a itemset, or transaction in the beer-milk example
the matrix is 100*102, representing 100 samples and 101 items( the first col is the sample ID)

col #2 ~ #101 are gene info, and they can only be UP or Down. The last col is deseae, accoring to Piazza, it should also be 
considered as a item, and there are 4 types of disease.

Since the gene types and disease types are of very limited kinds, I use integers to code them.
UP - 1, Down - 1, 
ALL - 1, AML -2, Breast Cancer -3, Colon Cancer -4

So the sample-item matrix is of dimension 100*101, with entries of value in [0,1,2,3,4]. no need to use string comparisons.

Then I give the items a sequence,
G1_up, G1_down, G2_up, G2_down, ..., G100_up, G100_down, ALL, AML, Breast Cancer, Colon Cancer
from 1 to 204.

so itemsets only contain the indice of items. if an itemset contain 3, it means G2_up is there.

frequent itemsets data structure:
In my code, I use fis, a cell array to record all frequent itemsets of different size.
fis{1}: frequent itemsets of  size 1
        a n1*1 matrix, n1 is the number of those frequent itemsets of  size 1
        
fis{2}: frequent itemsets of  size 2
        a n2*2 matrix, n2 is the number of those frequent itemsets of  size 2, and each row is an frequent itemset.
        
....

the size of fis, k ,shows the number of item of the largest frequent itemsets
    
This way, all the frequent itemsets are stored, and its easy to get the number of frequent itemsets of size i, 1<= i <= k
