kNN.py contains our implementation of Nearest Neighbors. The input file can be modified on line 97. The input file should be in .csv format. The program can be run with the command "python kNN.py" The program prints out the Accuracy, precision, recall and F value.  

bayes.py contains our implementation of Naive Bayes. The input file can be modified on line 282. The program can be run with the command "python bayes.py." The program prints out the Accuracy, precision, recall and F value.  


decision_tree.py contains our implementation of decision tree with prepruning and boosting( function Adaboosting) and k-fold cross validation for regular decision tree and boosting. The program can be run with the command "python decision_tree.py." The program prints out the Accuracy, precision, recall and F value for each round of cross validation as well as their average. It can also print out the structure of the learned decision tree and details of each tree node.
